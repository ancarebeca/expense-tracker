# Expense-tracker

Given a csv with the last summary of a bank account, it organises this expenses in categories 
(bills, shopping, eating out â€¦) and then it will be saved into an Expense database.  
After that, these data will be represented in a dashboard

Services:

- Extraction: Load en memory a csv file from a bank account
- Transformation: Normalized csv data
- Categorize: Set categories to each expense (In progress)
- Load: Load data into a database
- Report: Show the information in a dashboard (In progress)

## Installation:

1. Install [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
 
2. Dependencies:

```
    make install
```

## Configuration:
1. Define configuration file:

```
#expense-tracker/config
    user_db: "your_db"
    pass_db: "your_db_password"
    database: "your_db"
    file_path: "path_your_bank_statement"
```

2. Link your description keyword with a category in  `expense-tracker/config/categories.yaml`: 

You have to link some relevant word from your bank statements with one category.
For example if in your bank statement in the description field you have 'Tfl.gov.uk/cp' you 
could categorise 'tfl' as transport. 

```
tfl: transport
my groceries shop: groceries
my favourite restaurant: eating out
atm machine: cash
thames water: bills
```

## Run tests: 

```
    make install
```

## Run app: 

```
    make all
```
###### This project is still in progress 

Todo: 
- Transformer logic is coupled to a specific csv file. Make it generic
- Parser logic is coupled to a specific data input. Make it generic
- Improve error handler
- Improve performance
- Refactor main
